/**
 * This sample program shows how to control a motor using a joystick. In the
 * operator control part of the program, the joystick is read and the value is
 * written to the motor.
 *
 * Joystick analog values range from -1 to 1 and speed controller inputs also
 * range from -1 to 1 making it easy to work together. The program also delays a
 * short time in the loop to allow other threads to run. This is generally a
 * good idea, especially since the joystick values are only transmitted from the
 * Driver Station once every 20ms.
